If you're referring to Google's **Gemini AI**, which is part of their next-generation AI models, it is still under development or being rolled out incrementally. Google announced Gemini as a competitor to OpenAI's GPT models, but specific versions like \"Gemini 2.5 Pro\" are not officially mentioned.\n\nIf you're asking about a different product or software, could you clarify further?",
